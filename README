cmdEx: Fixes for cmd.exe
Scott Graham <scott.cmdex@h4ck3r.net>
-------------------------------------

cmdEx makes some small improvements to cmd.exe. Currently:

- In PROMPT, $M displays git branch information instead of its normal function.
- Suppress "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" prompt (prompt isn't displayed, and
  the assumed answer is always 'y').

Possible future features? (Not implemented)
- Increase command history length
- Save command history across shells
- Improve tab completion (maybe override dir completion?)
  - git commands
  - git branch completion
- Alt-Up == "cd .."
- Alt-Left/Right navigate through directory history


cmdEx is currently only known to work on Windows 7 and Windows 8, and only when
using the x86 cmd.exe.


Build:

C:\...\cmdEx>python sng.py -u           # -u pulls third_party dependencies
C:\...\cmdEx>third_party\ninja\ninja


Optionally Test:

C:\...\cmdEx>out\tests
C:\...\cmdEx>python test.py


Run:

C:\...\cmdEx>out\cmdEx
[master] C:\...cmdEx>



Similar project, but more wholesale behaviour replacement:

Clink's.
