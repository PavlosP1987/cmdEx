cmdEx: Fixes for cmd.exe
Scott Graham <scott.cmdex@h4ck3r.net>
-------------------------------------

cmdEx makes some small improvements to cmd.exe. Currently:

- In PROMPT, $M displays git branch information instead of its normal function.

(TODO) - Suppress "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" prompt.


cmdEx is currently only known to work on Windows 7 and Windows 8, and only when
using the x86 cmd.exe.


Build:

mkdir third_party && ^
cd third_party && ^
git clone git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git && ^
cd libgit2 && ^
cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" -DSTDCALL=Off && ^
devenv.com libgit2.sln /Build Release && ^
cd ..\.. && ^
call m.bat


Run:

C:\...\cmdEx>cmdEx
[master] C:\...cmdEx>



Similar project, but more wholesale behaviour replacement:

Clink's.
